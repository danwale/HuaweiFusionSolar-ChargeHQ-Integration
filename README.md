# Huawei Fusion Solar to ChargeHQ Push API Integration Module
The intention of this integration is to poll the Huawei Fusion Solar API to determine how much solar power is being generated vs how much is being consumed from the grid and provide this to ChargeHQ's Push API that will enable ChargeHQ to regulate the charge rate of a Tesla car to maximise the use of solar energy rather than grid supplied power.

It is in early development and testing with my own home setup, once it's fully tested I'll update the instructions on how to get this running for anyone else with a Huawei Solar Inverter and ChargeHQ and a Tesla to charge.

Happy EV motoring, charging as cleanly (and cheaply) as possible!
